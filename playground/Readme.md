# Running in Google Chrome

Running in Google Chrome does need a local http-server. Therefore following linux shell commands need to be executed:

    sudo npm install -g http-server  
    cd PATH/Catblocks  
    http-server

then head to `localhost:8080/playground/playground.html` in your browser.
